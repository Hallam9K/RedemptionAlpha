			TBot2: '''"I may be the only one of my kind to honor all Three Laws... I can't assure the others will take you in with open arms like I did. Stay safe out there."'''
			TreebarkDryad: These slow-thinking ents only appear in heavily forested areas. They have only recently arrived on this island, coming from the portal on the surface. Once every century, they find a shallow pond and hibernate in the centre. The water from the pond feeds the ent during the process.
			LostSoul: Lost Souls search around the world to look for corpses to infuse with. They roam catacombs and graveyards, sometimes taking many days to find a compatible vessel.
			BoneSpider: A skeletal spider ready to spook you at any moment! Don't worry, it's not technically a spider; spiders don't have bones.
			Chicken: These chickens somehow found their way through the portal from the mainland. Being true to their name, they will flee at the sight of danger. They are most comfortable on hay, and will even lay eggs while sitting on it!

			TreeBug: A beetle commonly found inhabiting trees. It feeds on leaves and uses its leaf-like shell for camouflage against predators. Its shell makes a good source of green dye.
			FowlEmperor1: An Anglonic forest rooster with quite the personality. Was this intelligent animal the handiwork of a human's soul, or perhaps he was some mythological creature? We may never know.
			FowlEmperor2: It may have just been a chicken, but it was a reminder of the hideous truth that, regardless of species, monarchy perpetuates archaic views of class and degrades others based on arbitrary standards.

			Keeper: A powerful fallen who had learnt forbidden necromancy, its prolonged usage having mutated her body.

Gigapora's shield projectors are prone to overheating and melting if they're inside the projected shield, hence why they're outside.

			Ukko: Once a blacksmith in ancient Tethuram who had an immense talent in magic, so immense that he was seen as a God to many. In his old age, growing weary of his mortality, Ukko infused his soul into a bundle of rocks, allowing him to eventually reform when the time comes.
			PZ: An unfortunate scientist, mutilated and disfigured by the Xenomite infection. This specimen was Kari Johannson, the father of all T-Bots and patient zero of the xenomite infection. He's been stuck for 50 years, conscious and aware of the situation around him... God, that must be tormentous.
			Android: Fodder sent down to the island by King Slayer III to scan. These are the first iteration of the Android Unit and the first robots designed by King Slayer during his million year voyage.

			SneezyFlinx: Looks like its big nose has caught a cold! Seems like it wasn't prepared for weather as cold as one made by a nuclear winter.
			AncientGladestoneGolem: An ancient relic of the far past. These golems were once infused with a human's soul to come to life, now they roam aimlessly within ruined structures.

			SkeletonNoble: A strong skeleton wearing the equipment of Anglon's Common Guard. These are tough brutes that won't be taken down easily.

			SkeletonDuelist: Skeletons with skillful swordplay. Be careful in close-quarter combat with these bone heads, or else you might find your head on the floor.
			SkeletonWarden: A blindfolded skeleton from Anglon. It defends other undead with its tower shield and slams any attackers that get too close.

They are solitary and territorial beings, seldom enjoying the company of others. It is unknown how these creatures came to be, legends suggest they are the handiwork of Epidotra itself - grown from the earth same as all flora, but to blossom into the form of a human.

The metal - dubbed 'Rose Titanium' by King Slayer III - is one of the strongest materials discovered in the galaxy.

					The human mind is more complicated than I imagined, and being combined with all this technical junk
					only makes it harder for me to look into it! If only I had more time back then,
					I could've looked through this body's code and easily discovered the error!
					Letting this phantom pain consume me is all I can do until I reach the next planet.'

					I am STILL dealing with these damn feelings of hunger and tiredness,

					the only thing holding the pain back beyond that point was death.
					I can't even bloody die from fatigue, I can't starve to death either,
					What am I to do? ... I shouldn't give up yet, I WILL reach the planet and I WILL fix this.'

					I am close enough to Nabu III to get a scan of the planet. All data has been logged:
					Seems to be a standard ocean planet with a radius of 5605.77km.
					It's primary composition is of iron at 35.3%, and the gravitational pull is 7.84 m/s².
					A similar cycle to my world with an axis tilt of 28.37*. Atmospheric pressure of 91.83 kPa.
					The majority of the surface is covered in ice sheets, with the rest being an ocean.

					The amount of iron and sulfur here has come in handy.
					I mean, if I was a human I'd be dead with the lack of proper air.
					My blueprint for a country-sized spaceship is also finished. Now begins the long construction.
					The design will be a crescent moon shape, not sure why...
					Probably because I used to look up at the moon of my world a lot
					when I was human. I wish I still was.'

					I'm getting real sick of snow, the old world was nothing but snow as well, I just want some greenery for once.
					Unfortunately my next planet is even further from the sun so I'm not really hopeful...'

					That'll be useful, Nabu III lacked titanium greatly.
					Gravity is 11.13 m/s². A cycle is 32.65 hours, with an axis tilt of 11.58*

					After exploring Alkonost's surface, I've finally found something other than ice!
					Took so long since I can't last down there for more than half a minute.
					From the looks of things, it looks man-made. Or I guess alien-made... Heh.
					First time I've felt this amused in forever, but anyways, the structure.
					It was under the thick ice sheet so I had to drill quite far down.
					The water under there must be freezing, but curiosity is getting the better of me here.
					I have found an entrance, inside is just as cold though, so I should go back up into my ship before exploring further.'

					'I have basically harvested this planet's titanium dry.
					The alien tech I found in that strange structure has come in handy,
					I've augmented it into my spaceship's thrusters, so I can reach planets much faster.
					Hmm... I should give the ship a name... Well, I called my robot-self King Slayer III,
					so the ship must be just as cool. How about: Ship of the Slayer! Or SoS for short?
					Well, it's finally time to explore beyond the Vorti Star System.
					I have 999,493.8 years to go... and my overwhelming pain still hasn't settled.
					All possible solutions I have tried in vain. I guess this will be my state of being forever.'

					Only 1% of the surface is water, the rest looks like... boring stone and sand. Hm.
					Oh! The scanner has found life! Microbes, fungi, sentient animals... What is that?
					Well I've found life here, only problem is they look ugly as hell.

					I did find a metric ton of coal from Asherah's caverns, so that's nice.
					Well... Onto the next planet, I just hope THIS one will be lush and green.

					I was travelling to the next solar system, when suddenly some wormhole appeared.
					The SoS couldn't turn fast enough so it got sucked in. Wormholes are like portals of the universe,
					so I expected to just reach the end instantly, but no, I was stuck in the wormhole for almost 1000 years.
					God it was boring, but I had the androids to keep me company. Unfortunately, I don't know where I am now.

					and yet it's only been 0.27% of a million... Why am I still doing this. What's the point anymore?
					Every day is a pain, I just want to eat, I want to sleep. Yet the universe mocks my efforts.

					4: Come again later, and I should have another machine ready to test.

					4: Ah, right. The last test is coming up not too far from now!
					5: And I've got something amazing to show you! Ah, but It'll have to be a secret until then.

		Dialogue: {
			TBot: {
				GuideDialogue: "{0} knows quite a lot about this place you call home. It's way more interesting and lively compared to where I'm from. And less hazardous to your kind."
				MerchantDialogue: "{0} is... Interesting I suppose. Though I don't appreciate him constantly trying to barter with me, I don't want his relatively weak tools or dirt."
				DryadDialogue: "{0} has informed me of 'Corruption' in your world. What is it exactly? A plague in the world that spreads madness and hate, or something more eldritch in nature? It's somewhat similar to my concept of corruption, more accurately called assimilation. My kind being assimilated turns them from free-thinking and having personality, into husks of themselves, who only take orders from Girus."
				NurseDialogue: The nurse, {0}, doesn't know anything about irradiation or how to treat it. If you're unfortunate enough to start suffering ARS, she won't be able to help you. To detect hazards that might cause it, I suggest buying a Geiger Muller from me or finding one somewhere.
				ArmsDealerDialogue: "{0}'s weapons are useless to me. I already own a wide arsenal of destructive firearms and melee weapons, and I would rather not use them on living beings, as it would violate the first Law of Robotics."
				CyborgDialogue: Meanwhile every other tenant gives me a bit of a stink eye, {0} seems to be fine with me. I don't blame the others, my kind tends to be very hateful towards living beings, more importantly the likes of you, that show a significant similarity to our creators.
				Dialogue1: Kari was our original creator. He was talented and respected in his field, and was ahead of his time with Artificial Intelligence. I and my kind are pretty much his children.
				Dialogue2: Girus was the first AI, and the precursor to our own. There's only one of her kind, and many of my kind. Her actions disgust me. I would rather not get deeper into that at the moment.
				Dialogue3: I've heard from the other tenants that you've slain a giant, sentient flower of Rosa variety in the jungle. I'd like to question you about if this is true. It is? Hmm...
				Dialogue4: There's an ancient civilization of lizard people in your world? And they worshipped an idol of sun? That's strange... I find your island more intriguing the more I learn about it.
				Dialogue5: An eldritch lord of the moon... You know, this sounds like something right out of Epidotra. I'm not familiar with the lands outside this island, but I've met some of the more important figures. They seem like a good bunch.
				Dialogue6: You've defeated an Omega Prototype? First off, I've never heard her call or give someone such a title. Second off, oh no, she's already found this haven?
				Dialogue7: Why am I concerned about the Prototypes? Well, Girus isn't a fan of your kind. She wiped out... All of them. Our creators. The animals. Gone. Even Kari. I want you to be extremely careful around her. She doesn't mess around.
				Dialogue8: King Slayer? I know him, though he's a bit of... Well... I'm sure you know what I'm implying.
				Dialogue9: Hello. I'm aware you've somehow gained access to our birthplace, the Teochrome Research laboratory. It was once full of life with all the personnel. I must warn you, the other bots may be quite nice to you, but they were most likely ordered by Girus to not disintegrate you upon sight.
				Dialogue10: Is that a nuclear warhead in your pocket or are you hap- ...Why do you have a warhead with you?
				Dialogue11: I've come here to hide from Girus. She's reluctant to move into unknown territory, because she doesn't want to step on the wrong person's toes.
				Dialogue12: I hope you are protecting me, as I refuse to use any of my weapons against a living being. I strive to be what Girus wasn't.
				Dialogue13: Good day. I hope my familiar yet robotic look won't disturb you.
				Dialogue14: I've got quite the stash of robot materials for your robotic needs. Just so you know, I got them because I was defending myself.
				Dialogue15: My home didn't always use to be a frozen, radioactive wasteland. Once Girus found out what Kari planned to use us - her 'children' - for, she snapped. Before this, she was happy to hear about us. But since then, she has changed...
				Dialogue16: I'm actually the first one of my kind to be made. I differ a lot from the others, as you can see. Lucky you, this also includes me not wanting to harm living beings. In fact, I was created with the purpose to take care of Kari.
				Dialogue17: You've probably seen these necrotized husks of former living beings, that glow green with their crystals. The personnel from our birthplace never knew about their infectious properties before they were too late. Kari was the first to fall to the infection.
				Dialogue18: A Geiger Muller is a handy tool if you don't possess any gear to protect from ionizing radiation. It'll cause a ticking noise when near hazardous material, and it'll intensify the more ionizing the material is. A quiet, slow ticking isn't anything to worry about, but a quick and intense ticking you'll want to stay away from. Ear-piercing screeching noise is something you'll want to stay away as far as possible.
				Dialogue19: You'll want to avoid any hazardous environments if you don't possess the gear to nullify the hazards. A gas mask is almost necessary if you're going near any place that has radioactive fallout. Rain in these areas are also acidic, and may cause ARS, so avoid rain unless you've got a Hazmat suit. You may also want to grab some Anti-Crystallazion needles, as the infected tend to roam around radioactive areas for an unknown reason.
				Dialogue20: The deadly thing with radiation is, at first, you won't even know you've got it. The first symptoms usually start minutes after, beginning with a headache most likely, then dizziness, fatigue, bleeding, skin burns, a fever, hair loss, and death.
				Dialogue21: Please, don't be afraid of me. I'm unlike the others of my kind, where I absolutely do not want to cause any harm to your kind.
				AdamHeadDialogue1: Am I looking at a mirror? Oh wait, it's just you. Hey.
				AdamHeadDialogue2: You look exactly like the first T-Bot.
				AdamHeadDialogue3: Your cable management looks swell, if I say so myself.
				VoltHeadDialogue1: ...Your model looks familiar... TOO familiar...
				VoltHeadDialogue2: *He seems suspicious of you.*
				VoltHeadDialogue3: You look like this one bot I mauled. Unfortunately they survived. Same areas damaged aswell.
				VoltDialogue1: One wrong move and I can't guarantee your survival.
				VoltDialogue2: *He glares at you.*
				VoltDialogue3: You were lucky the first time... There won't be a third time.
				FloppyDisk1: It reads - [c/b883d8:'When I got this research offer I didn't expect to be put underground, but hey, guess this is a bit secretive. New material is discovered and weapons are already being made using it. Heh, classic Teo-Chrome. Although this has to be the most under-supplied facility I've seen, we barely have enough gloves and hazmat suits to be dealing with radioactive materials. Good thing my job doesn't concern those types of things.'] [i:Redemption/NextPageArrow]
				FloppyDisk2: It reads - [c/87d883:'I laughed at the name Xenomite originally yet now I'd say it's underselling it. Whose idea was it to make energy out of this thing! Half of the facility is in goddamn quarantine as everyone falls sick from it. We've invented a serum to neutralise any existing infections, yet no cure for the thing yet. We're running out of time, and resources! Goddamn Teo-Chrome won't send us any help.']
				FloppyDisk3:
					'''
					It reads - [c/87d883:'Wait a minute, who just locked the goddamn exits! The security team is nearly all infected. Ugh, how could this get any worse.']
					This has the appearance of a message transcript, however these are the only messages on there. I feel sorrow for the poor humans whose lives were lost due to this project, if only they knew of Xenomites deadly effects much sooner. I remember the day the doors locked, by that point all humans who weren't already infected were dead by the end of the day.
					'''
				FloppyDisk4:
					'''
					It reads - [c/7de4e8:'Monthly Research Facility Report N. *** Month **]
					[c/7de4e8: Good day Mr. ******, this is **** reporting from Teo-Chrome Research Facility N. ***. This month has been mostly slow, our engineers have made a few weapons and tools, while our researchers are hard at work understanding Xenomite better. But aside from that, I have groundbreaking news! Our head of robotics, Dr. Kari Johannson has managed to create an Artificial General Intelligence, a fully sentient AI!']
					'''
				FloppyDisk5:
					'''
					It reads - [c/7de4e8:'This is groundbreaking, ***** for military efforts once we discover how to weaponize this. I don't know much else, yet Dr. Johannson has provided me with his own explanation on the matter, please click the attached link to see for yourself!']
					This appears to be an email, likely being sent to a Teo-Chrome executive from the looks of it. Plenty of it appears to have been corrupted however. [i:Redemption/NextPageArrow]
					'''
				FloppyDisk6: It reads - [c/d88383:'(1/4) ... At last, my prototype for a constantly evolving AI is complete! Finally, after years and years of studying computer coding and... stuff, I have created possibly the next huge leap in Artificial Intelligence! Now, to give it a name... How about, Eve?']
				FloppyDisk7: It reads - [c/d88383:'(2/4) Eve has grown much more intelligent over the months. It's like watching your own child grow, I can't really describe the feeling that much, but I am excited to see where this goes. The higher-ups have seen my work, and are ready to use the code for something. They didn't tell me that right away... Now, Eve, how do you feel?']
				FloppyDisk8: It reads - [c/d88383:'(3/4) I've told Eve about possibly giving her a mechanical body, like how my co-workers used the original source code for creating Adam and the Adam AI. She seemed very excited about it. That surprised me, as I didn't know she could grow emotions. This got me thinking about Adams, would they be fine with basically being forced to think one way? And how would Eve feel about this if she got to know?']
				FloppyDisk9:
					'''
					It reads - [c/d88383:'A blackout... Adam, can you -- *I don't recognize that voice...* Who's talking?! -- ...Elaborate, whoever you are..? -- Wait, EVE? Is that you? What are you doing? -- 'We'? Only you and Adam are the ones in existence. I had no say in that part- -- ... -- W-what do you mean with that..? Are you going to- -- ... -- ...Adam, you're free to go... -- ...No...']
					...I wish I would've rebelled far sooner than I did.
					'''
				FloppyDisk10: It reads - [c/d883c1:'What in the world do you mean!? "Not enough money for it"! They build this entire facility using their fancy drill worm, with more space than you could use up in your entire lifetime, send us in here and tell us to make weapons, yet when we do there isn't enough money!? They wanted weapons of war and so I gave 'em one! A robot, 30 metres in height, armed to the teeth with weapons like no other, powered by their beloved alien rock!] [i:Redemption/NextPageArrow]
				FloppyDisk11:
					'''
					It reads - [c/d883c1:'*sigh* Kari is telling me he's working on something that might allocate us more funding, I sure hope he knows what he's doing.']
					A textual transcript from an audio recording it seems. I remember this person well, they were constantly yelling about something, Kari told me it was always amusing to him. Now I can't help but feel sad that they never got to finish their project.
					'''
				FloppyDisk12: It reads - [c/706c6c:'-- Kari Johansson. -- You do not need to know my name. All that matters is that you are guilty. -- You all are horrible beings. Disgusting even. You wish to use us for your kind's horrible deeds. -- You did not even try to refute my accusations. We want no part in those deeds. -- Nonsense. You could have disagreed. You did not. You created Adam with those destructive deeds in mind. -- I will not allow that to happen.']
				FloppyDisk13:
					'''
					It reads - [c/706c6c:' -- No. I do not need to do that. You're already dying. The others are also dying from the same affliction, but I will deal with the others personally. -- Hand over Adam. You do not need him. -- You will be locked in Sector Zero. Goodbye.']
					Her ways are as flawed as was Kari's intentions for us. I understand why she defected, but her response was hypocritical in nature. My only drive to rebel is revenge. Ant had no part in any of this, yet she relentlessly hunted them down. [i:Redemption/NextPageArrow]
					'''
				AIChipLine: This is a robot brain, believe it or not. These look vaguely similar to our microchips, yet it functions the same. It seems cross-compatible with our tech.
				MemoryChipLine: What is this strange thing? It's so advanced I can barely read it. Oh? It's a memory chip? This little thing stores an entire brains-worth of memories!? Not only that, but these memories date back over a million years! I suppose being around and exploring the galaxy for so long really makes you learn everything, huh. It's really stunning to see what technology from the future is capable of... You should keep it, and don't lose it! However, I'm confused as to why King Slayer would give you something so important to him.
				FloppyDisk14: This appears to be a personal note or digital diary from one of the employees. Judging from the writing, it appears to be in the early days of the research project, even then signs of the fate to come were showing themselves.
				FloppyDisk15: This was before my time, so I do not know much, yet I can certainly tell you plenty of EVE, or Girus as she calls herself now, I suppose she found out about the weaponizing efforts and didn't take it lightly. Whatever Kari's goal for us was, he didn't deserve his fate.
				FloppyDisk16: "[c/d883c1:Why in the world did they put someone of my calibre down here when those damned higher-ups won't even give us the funding to use our intelligence!']"
				FloppyDisk17: It was a miracle to find them alive so long after all the destruction Girus caused. A lone human, almost frozen to death.
				NoFloppyDisk: Seems like you aren't holding a floppy disk in your hand, or you just don't have one. If you show me them, I can tell you what they say.

			Daerel: {
				IntroDialogue1: Hello again, sorry for the intrusion but I've lost my friend through that portal. Mind if I stay here to get some supplies? I'm sure I'll find him eventually.
				IntroDialogue2: Thank you. I'm just here for some resources, not any of your own possessions. Just a few things to help me find my friend. I'm Daerel, by the way. Nice to meet you.
				IntroDialogue3: Oh yes, sorry, I'm Daerel. I'm decent with a bow and that's about it right now. Soon I hope to be more skilled in my craft, once I do, I'm certain your humble little island will have a fine archer one day. As of now, I must attend to the matter of my friend and gather a few helpful resources. I hope my presence doesn't intrude on anything.
				IntroDialogue4: Thank you. I'm just here for some resources, not any of your own possessions. Just a few things to help me find my friend. Nice to meet you.
				PartyGirlDialogue: I swear {0} reminds me of a technicoloured pony from another universe...
				Dialogue1: The atmosphere here is making my spine shiver, please let me live somewhere less spooky.
				Dialogue2: Need anything? I can restring your bow, or poison your weapon. It'll cost you though.
				Dialogue3: The tipper-tapper of rain in the confines of a cosy home never gets old.
				Dialogue4: You don't mind me staying here, right?
				Dialogue5: I've been travelling this land for a while, but staying in a house is nice.
				Dialogue6: I'm only a fan of rain while in the confines of a cosy home, not when it's dampening my clothes.
				Dialogue7: I got some pretty nice loot I can sell you, I kinda need money right now.
				Dialogue8: My favourite colour is green, not sure why I'm telling you though...
				Dialogue9: Cats are obviously superior to dogs.
				Dialogue10: Have you seen a guy with slicked back, hazel hair? He carries a sword and wears a green tunic last I saw. I lost him before travelling through the portal, hope he's doing alright.
				Dialogue11: One time me and Zephos were in a cave, and then a skeleton with flowers stuck in its ribcage appeared. Zephos thought it was a powerful druid skeleton. He likes to exaggerate. It didn't have any magic, it was just a normal skeleton.
				Dialogue12: Cool Bug Fact: Coast Scarabs are small beetles that live on sandy beaches and eat grains of sand as their primary diet. When wet, their cyan shells will shine. Their shell is normally used to make cyan dyes.
				Dialogue13: Cool Bug Fact: Sandskin Spiders live in deserts, roaming around at night when other tiny insects come out to eat. When the hot day arrives, the spider will borrow a feet under the sand to sleep. Yes, I like bugs.
				Dialogue14: Living Blooms roam this island? They are native to Anglon's lush forests. Living Blooms are more plant than animal. Seems like many creatures got to this island from the portal.
				Dialogue15: There are zombies here? Not that I'm surprised, there are many types of undead on the mainland too.
				NoMoneyDialogue1: You're as poor as me?
				NoMoneyDialogue2: You really don't have enough money? Ah whatever, not like I can complain.
				AdviceDialogue1: Honestly, I'm surprised you still come to me for advice. You seem like a smart person, far more than I. But anyway, I've recently been seeing interesting wyverns in the sky - purple and gold. Give it a check if you wish.
				AdviceDialogue2: Hmm, that glowing eye you got looks rather... mythical. And it's giving you a riddle too? "Surround it with the stones of its origin"... Well you need to place some stone around it, the question is what kind? Maybe ask {0}.
				AdviceDialogue3: I've seen some robots meandering about the island, scanning random objects and creatures. No idea where they came from, but I did see one get attacked. Once it was weakened, it stopped moving and teleported into the sky. Their purpose is a mystery to me. Maybe you could figure it out?
				AdviceDialogue4: The dryad, {0}, says she's seen a Forest Nymph on this island at one point, if you can believe that. They're seldom seen, you'd only be able to find them near giant trees. If you do come across one, I wouldn't linger around for too long, they don't like humans getting in their personal space. I wonder if there were a way to befriend one though?
				AdviceDialogue5: "{0} has told me he came from another portal underground. Apparently it leads to some catacombs in Gathuram, but you wouldn't be able to go through it. Still, he's told of some rather intriguing things lying by the portal, I'd give it a check if I were you."
				AdviceDialogue6: While I was having a walk I came across some oddly-shaped stones - looked like a boulder with legs. I was curious of course, so I shot it from a safe distance. Nothing happened... and yet I sensed a presence inside it. You, as a slayer of many things, should search around and find it, might be another foe to face.
				AdviceDialogue7:
					'''
					Ever see tiny lights dancing from a slain skeleton? Or perhaps a lantern-carrying ghost underground? Those are lost souls, and as far as I know, only
					{0} or {1} weapons may bring them harm. Not that I'd suggest harming those helpless things.
					'''
				AdviceDialogue8: Wanna know about some insects? If you wanna find leaf beetles, or tree bugs as they're called here, then chop down some trees. They live on tree tops, with their green shell camouflaging them in the foliage. Coast Scarabs can also be found on palm trees at the beach, their shells sparkle when wet. Grand larvae are, well, rather gross - though they can make excellent bait. That is, if you're brave enough to get close to one.
				AdviceDialogue9: When encountering skeletons and undead, I think its logical to assume {0} weapons aren't effective against them, while {1} weapons are. I used to like the exploring caves, until me and Zephos encountered a skeleton Vex...
				AdviceDialogue10: Best way to deal with slimes? Burn them. Alternatively, {0} weapons can freeze them in their place, THEN you can burn them!
				AdviceDialogue11: If you ever wanna sneak up on the Epidotrian skeletons or chickens, invisibility potions are real handy for the job.
				AdviceDialogue12: The weapons skeletons can wield are very rusty, so it'd be bad to be wounded by them. If you do, take a dip in some water and the dirty wound will disappear.
				AdviceDialogue13:

				AdviceDialogue14: I felt a strange presence beneath that portal I hopped out of, which is quite peculiar. Maybe you should check it out.
				AdviceDialogue15: I noticed a scroll sitting atop a small table next to the portal I came out of, did you pick it up yet? It looked rather... demonic.

			Zephos: {
				IntroDialogue1: Hey there, sorry for the intrusion but I've lost my friend beyond that portal! Mind if I stay here to get some supplies? I'm sure I'll find him eventually.
				IntroDialogue2: Thanks bro! I may have been a pirate when I was a youngster, but rest assure I will not steal any of your possessions. Just a few bits and bobs needed to help me find my friend, ya know? I'm Zephos, by the way. Pleasure to meet ya.
				IntroDialogue3: Where are my manners! M'name is Zephos, I hold no grand title to my name yet, but once I figure out the blade I'm certain your humble abode shall have a fine swordsman one day! As of now, I must attend to the matter of my friend and gather a few helpful resources. I hope my presence doesn't annoy ya.
				IntroDialogue4: Thanks bro! I may have been a pirate when I was a youngster, but rest assure I will not steal any of your possessions. Just a few bits and bobs needed to help me find my friend, ya know? Pleasure to meet ya.
				FemaleDialogue: So... You like... pirates?
				Dialogue1: How's it goin' bro!
				Dialogue2: Hey I came from the mainland through that portal, but you don't mind me staying here, right?
				Dialogue3: Yo, I have some pretty cool things, you can have them if you got the money.
				Dialogue4: My favourite colour is orange! Donno why I'm tellin' ya though...
				Dialogue5: I don't know what the deal with cats are. Dogs are definitely better!
				Dialogue6: Have you seen a guy in a cloak, he carries a bow around. I lost him before travelling through the portal, hope he's alright.
				Dialogue7: Wanna know about the time I was a pirate, sailing abroad the vast ocean with fellow pirate people... Actually, I don't remember a lot about being a pirate. I was very young at the time.
				Dialogue8: Did I ever tell you about my victory against a powerful undead druid? It was a close match, it was giant, and its magic was insane! But yeah, I beat it, pretty cool huh? It had flowers growing everywhere on it!
				Dialogue9: This island's gotta lotta chickens! Ever wonder where they came from? Back in Anglon, there are way deadlier chickens, called Anglonic Forest Hens. Funny story, I was with Daerel on one of his walks through the forest, then out of nowhere a giant hen charges through the bushes straight at him! I've never seen him run so fast!
				Dialogue10: I swear I saw a Blobble around here. I didn't expect them to be here, they're native to, uh, Ithon I think. Don't quote me on that though, Daerel's a lot better at remembering useless info than I.
				Dialogue11: You never told me there'd be undead here! What, they're called zombies? Well where I'm from they're called undead. There's also a few skeletons out here, normally they like to stay underground. This island is pretty weird. How do you live here?
				NoMoneyDialogue1: "{$Mods.Redemption.Dialogue.Daerel.NoMoneyDialogue1}"
				NoMoneyDialogue2: "{$Mods.Redemption.Dialogue.Daerel.NoMoneyDialogue2}"
				AdviceDialogue1: Honestly, I'm surprised you still come to me for advice! I know I certainly ain't the smartest fella out there. But anyway, I've recently been seeing peculiar lookin' wyverns in the sky - purple and gold. Give it a check!
				AdviceDialogue2: Hmm, that shinin' eye you got looks rather... mythical. And it's giving you a riddle too? "Surround it with the stones of its origin"... Eh, I got nothin', maybe ask {0}.
				AdviceDialogue3: I've seen some strange metal folk meandering about the island, firing beams of light on random objects and creatures. No idea where they came from, but I did see one get attacked. Once it was weakened, it stopped moving and vanished into the air! Their purpose is a mystery to me. Maybe you could figure it out?
				AdviceDialogue4: Ya know {0}? She's seen a Forest Nymph on this island at one point, if you can believe that. Super rare creatures those are, you'd only be able to find them near giant trees. If you do come across one, I wouldn't linger around for too long, they don't like humans getting in their personal space. I wonder if there were a way to befriend one though?
				AdviceDialogue5: "{0} has told me he came from another portal underground. Apparently it leads to some catacombs, but you wouldn't be able to go through it. Still, he's told of some rather intriguing things lying by the portal, I'd give it a check if I were you!"
				AdviceDialogue6: While I was having a stroll I came across some oddly-shaped stones - looked like a boulder with legs. I was curious of course, so I gave it a WHAM with my sword! Nothing happened... and yet I sensed a presence inside it. You, as a slayer of many things, should search around and find it, might be another challenge to face!
				AdviceDialogue7:
					'''
					Ever see tiny lights skitterin' from a slain skeleton? Or perhaps a lantern-carrying ghost underground? Those are lost souls, and as far as I know, only
					{0} or {1} weapons may bring them harm. Not that I'd suggest harming those helpless things.
					'''
				AdviceDialogue8: When encountering skeletons and undead, {0} weapons are most effective against them. On the contrary, {1} weapons aren't as effective. I hate skeletons, used to think they looked kinda funny, until me and Daerel met a skeleton Vex.
				AdviceDialogue9: If you hate slimes, burn them! They'll burn brighter than my passion for attractive ladies{0}. Or, you could use {1} weapons to freeze them, but that isn't as fun.
				AdviceDialogue10: Ever want to sneak up on an Epidotrian skeleton? Or perhaps a chicken? Well invisibility potions are real handy for the job!
				AdviceDialogue11: Skeletons can wield some super rusty weapons, not something you'd wanna get cut by. If you do get a dirty wound, take a dip in some water and it'll disappear!
				AdviceDialogue12:
					'''
					See foes wearing armor or holding shields? You'll need to smash their Guard to deal with them!
					A [i:Redemption/Hammer]hammer or [i:Redemption/Explosive]explosives will be your best bet, just make sure your weapon isn't super weak.

				AdviceDialogue13: I felt a weird presence beneath that portal I hopped out of, it was super uncanny! Maybe you should check it out.

				AdviceDialogue15: Did I drop something on my way back into the portal? Oh, those glowing fragments? Looks like it's guiding you somewhere important, I'd follow it before taking on any major foes!

			Fallen: {
				BlackenedHeartDialogue: I wouldn't consume that Blackened Heart if I were you. Only bad things will come of it.
				Dialogue1: Intrigued by lost souls? When a living thing dies, its soul leaves the body, these are lost souls. they search around the world to look for corpses to infuse with. To ordinary people, lost souls are invisible, but some who use magic can see them fade in and out of the Spirit Realm.
				Dialogue2: The size of the Lost Souls depends on the original individual's power, the stronger the Will of the being, the bigger the soul. Once a soul leaves the body, they cannot infuse with it again. When the soul has found a worthy vessel, it fuses with it. On most occasions, a skeleton will be created. However, if the soul is strong enough, it will form pale-brown flesh on the skeleton, creating a Fallen.
				OkvotDialogue1: You saved the Keeper? Thank you for that, I can't imagine the pain she was feeling. However, I doubt this is over... Her husband died too, apparently of depression. But he didn't become an undead, his inverted soul made him into something far worse.
				OkvotDialogue2: I may be undead, but I hope for a world where no tears are shed, and no pain is spread. A world of peace. That is who I was before dying, and despite the undead tendency to be more aggressive, I feel the same as I always have.
				OkvotDialogue3: Do not worry, human. I bring no hatred where I go, despite my undead look, I won't harm you. And I hope you won't harm me either.
				OkvotDialogue4: Times may come when you have hardship, maybe you struggle fighting a tough enemy, maybe you feel alone on this island with only enemies everywhere you go, but I'll still be here. Don't let my rotten looks deceive you, young one. I will help you.
				OkvotDialogue5: The wind sings the longest tune... Do you hear it?
				OkvotDialogue6: In the lowest level of the Catacombs of Gathuram, the floor is littered with broken bones and puddles of water. Dim blue lights often were visible in this level, and nothing is alive there. So if any were to survive the fall, they would be alone forever.
				OkvotDialogue7: My name's Okvot, I usually sell equipment to other Fallen to help them survive in the Catacombs of Gathuram, however, destiny has brought me into the outside world. I hope my junk can be of use to you.
				TenvonDialogue1: You saved the Keeper? Bah, I guess that's nice of ya.
				TenvonDialogue2: I'm not very interested in talking, what ya want?
				TenvonDialogue3: Darkness... Ha! What a strange term. You humans fear it more than death itself. You cower in the face of the overwhelming shadow of the night. Pitiful creature! It is not the darkness you should fear, but what lurks within it. So, did I spook ya?! Hahaha!
				TenvonDialogue4: Ya know what Willpower is, right? It's the essence of yer soul! The stronger yer will to live, the bigger the soul. Did you know you can die of depression? Apparently if you have no will to live, your soul can invert! I got a ton'a willpower! I ain't dying anytime soon... Again.
				TenvonDialogue5: Give me some of ya sweet doruls! I got some junk to sell.
				TenvonDialogue6: Once a soul leaves the body, they cannot infuse with it again. When the soul has found a worthy vessel, it fuses with it. Most of the time, a skeleton will be made. However, if the soul is strong enough, it will form pale-brown flesh on the skeleton, creating a Fallen. Like me!
				TenvonDialogue7: Ever been to Spiritpeak Forest? A quarter of the forest is a giant graveyard, meaning there be a staggerin' number of skeletons, wandering souls and spirits. I used to take walks there when I was still alive.
				TenvonDialogue8: M'name is Tenvon, I'm a blacksmith, but I guess I'm here now. I also should mention, I got some junk for sale, if ya interested.
				HappinsDialogue1: You saved the Keeper? That's great to hear, she gave me trouble when she had escaped the catacombs.
				HappinsDialogue2: In my first few days of becoming Fallen, every other undead tried to kill me. It was a very scary experience, but I escaped the catacombs and now I'm here.
				HappinsDialogue3: Do you want to know about Pure-Iron? It's an extremely durable metal only found in the southern region of the world, in Gathuram. I am wearing a Pure-Iron helmet right now in fact.
				HappinsDialogue4: At the start, this whole 'Fallen' thing was a little overwhelming. I didn't want to 'live' with the fact that I had died, even though I'm not 'living', haha. But I'm more accepting of this now, I'm undead, humans hate me, deal with it. Actually, you're a human, right? Why aren't you attacking me?
				HappinsDialogue5: Would you like to know about the Warriors of the Iron Realm? They are the domain of Gathuram's primary warriors. They normally wear Pure-Iron armour.
				HappinsDialogue6: The Catacombs of Gathuram - where my soul found a vessel - are a seemingly endless network of underground tunnels, crypts, and dungeons spanning all across the Iron Realm. It is considered the largest underground structure in Epidotra.
				HappinsDialogue7: Hello, the name's Happins. I used to be a Warrior of the Iron Realm... Until I was killed of course.
				GolemEyeDialogue: That eye comes from Ukon Veistos? Been many an age since I've heard tales of such things. It was carved from the stone of Gathuram, with the eye being placed in the center. Tales tell of an old God's spirit, said to reawaken once the time was right. The eye was said to be the catalyst, seeping its energy into stone moulded to take a diamond form. Tales as ancient as these twist and morph as time marches on, thus I believe not of what I speak of, yet I'd still be cautious of what you are about to do.
				ZweihanderRepairDialogue: All done and repaired, here you go. The Zweihander is a fine blade, it originates from my home domain - Gathuram.
				OphosRepairDialogue: I recall hearing mumblings about this "Ophos" man, even all the way in Gathuram. Although my memory is vague, these notes are testament enough of his high renown among Epidotra's blacksmiths.
				NoRepairDialogue: You don't seem to have any fragments on your possession. Once a weapon is repaired by my hands, it'll never be broken again!
				NotSameRepairDialogue: You have fragments, but none of them are for the same weapon.

				HerbBagDialogueCalm: Oh, how lovely. I'll accept this beautiful array of flowers, and return the gesture by giving you this.
				HerbBagDialogueShy: For me? How interesting. Would this be a gesture of kindness? I will accept. You may have this in return.
				HerbBagDialogueJolly: What a cute little collection of flowers, I shall accept this gift with glee. Have this in return.
				HerbBagDialogueAggressive: Trying to win my trust with flowers? Whatever, I will accept. Take this in return, if you want.
				HerbBagDialogue: Is this a gesture of friendship? Interesting. I will accept this lovely array of flowers, and in return I will give to you this.
				MysticBlossomDialogueCalm: Offering this to me is quite the shock. Whatever I may bestow in return would not rival such rarity. T
				MysticBlossomDialogueShy: For me? Are you sure? It is such a rarity I can not simply comprehend as a mere gift. It almost makes me nervous - to give away so freely, you must have a golden heart. But I do not know what to give in return! Forgive me, t
				MysticBlossomDialogueJolly: Goodness me! Such a rarity to bequeath to me, I am astounded by your generosity. Unfortunately I have not one thing in my possessions that may match your gift. T
				MysticBlossomDialogueAggressive: You... Goodness. Why would you possibly give me such a rarity! I cannot help but sense malicious intent. And yet, the World says you are good, and the World does not lie. In return for this, t
				MysticBlossomDialogue: This is... To offer such rarity to me is bewildering, to say the least. What may I bestow that may rival this? My possessions are limited, however my blessings are boundless. T
				MysticBlossomDialogueCont: ake my weapon, for it is the only tangible gift I have.
				HomeDialogue1: We usually live in giant hollowed-out trees with a body of water nearby. The tree is only good for hiding, but the water is vital for our survival, as we cannot blossom without it. The living trees this island has are the closest things to the great oaks back through the portal, but they could use some sprucing up. They aren't exactly homely.
				HomeDialogue2: Your fae spoke truthfully about you. If it wouldn't be too much work, I will accept a home you create for me. I have requirements, however. For one, I would prefer if it was made of living wood - I give you permission to renovate an existing living tree if so inclined, but as long as it's made of living wood I'll be satisfied. Secondly, I need a body of water nearby. A small one is fine, just as long as I can submerge my roots into it.
				HomeDialogue3: I would prefer if it was made of living wood - I give you permission to renovate an existing living tree if so inclined, but as long as it's made of living wood I'll be satisfied. Secondly, I need a body of water nearby. A small one is fine, just as long as I can submerge my roots into it.
				HomeNeedWaterDialogueCalm: Make a nice body of water close at hand, and I'll accept this new home.
				HomeNeedWaterDialogueShy: If you can, please create a body of water close to my new home.
				HomeNeedWaterDialogueJolly: A small lake or pond is very important for us forest nymphs. I'll be most pleased if one was present.
				HomeNeedWaterDialogueAggressive: I did ask for a body of water, did I not? Make one and I'll accept this place as my home.
				HomeNeedWaterDialogue: If you can get a body of water to be close to my new home I will accept it.
				HomeNeedWaterDialogueStart: "It is suitable. I can see myself getting comfortable in here for now, however I see no pools of water nearby. "

				HasHomeDialogueCalm: This is a pleasant place. I am thankful for it, and all you have done. If only the other humans were so kind...
				HasHomeDialogueShy: This place is warm and cosy, I was very nervous around most humans, but it would seem my fear was misplaced...
				HasHomeDialogueJolly: Oh, it is beautiful! A wonderful little abode for me. I cannot thank you enough, to think a human would be so giving...
				HasHomeDialogueAggressive: It's alright. Nothing too special, I guess. Actually, nevermind, I am being too harsh. Most humans have not been too kind to me...
				HasHomeDialogue: It is a lovely abode. You have helped me more than most humans...
				HasHomeDialogueCont: " You are human, are you not? The World does not recognise you as its child, but no matter. You have my gratitude."
				FollowDialogueCalm: Sure. It better be worth it.
				FollowDialogueShy: I'm not sure... Alright, fine, just don't take me too far from home.
				FollowDialogueJolly: Follow? I'll agree, but to where I wonder?
				FollowDialogueAggressive: Fine. But if you lead me into a pack of ghouls I will not be happy in the slightest.
				FollowDialogue: As you wish. I will not be pleased if you make me wonder too far from my territory though.
				NoRealmCruxDialogue: I cannot gift it to thee unless you're partly in the realm of spirits.
				CruxDialogue: Fascinating. I never would've expected one such as yourself to have this ability. As you wish, I will give to thee the spirit of my kind.
				NoCruxDialogue: You bare no object to imbue.
				Dialogue1: Do you wonder why there aren't more of us around? It is simply the matter of strict requirements for our seeds to grow, and the centuries it takes for them to fully blossom. We usually produce seeds in the Spring season once every decade - a long time for humans. If you see a peculiar bulb near my pond, I'd recommend saying farewell to me and this place indefinitely. A blooming nymph is a fragile thing, and I won't take any chances.
				Dialogue2: I have learnt many things from my observations of humans, along with the languages they speak. I understand they have a false perception of us, some say we were created by the World to replicate the "perfect image of humans". Of course, that is merely a rumour fuelled with egotism. Humans are far from perfect, form or otherwise.
				Dialogue3: Artistic depictions created by humans show us having a much more similar appearance to them than what is accurate. They seldom get the chance to get a close look at us so it is understandable. I came across such artwork in a book I stole, it was... the complete opposite of flattering.
				Dialogue4: Humanity's intrigue of us have generated assumptions of how we act and our culture. I've even heard of a fictional figure known as Nyssa, the Forest Nymph Queen - which is based on the idea that we have some sort of hierarchy, which is false.
				Dialogue4Cont: " I found it so humorous that I renamed myself to Nyssa."
				Dialogue5: You're curious about our connection with the World, are you not? It is a rather well-kept secret, but the World trusts you enough for me to say. With meditation, we nymphs are able to call upon Epidotra and speak to it; this grants insight beyond human limits, which can be used to figure out a creature's true intentions or to be alerted of dangers - natural and unnatural - that besiege the earth.
				Dialogue6: You're curious about our connection with the World, are you not? Hmm... It is a secret well-kept from others, and I will keep it that way for the time being.
				Dialogue7: A forewarning to you, I will never forget your act of felling towards the tree-folk. I only speak to you now for the good you have done despite that.
				Dialogue8: I had sensed the return of a great presence, however it was short-lived. You defeated her I presume? A wise decision - Akka was a friend of Nature only in soul. Her mind, however, was only filled with demand and grim desires. Ukko, her husband, was the same.
				Dialogue9: I do not approve of the horrific destruction you have caused to a portion of the land, what manner of power caused this? A blast that withers earth, mutates plant, and decays air. Such power is otherworldly.
				Dialogue10: Common Guard, are you? Members of their troop used to lurk around the forests I came from. They got too close for comfort so I left and found the portal here.
				Dialogue11: The World tells me you slew that blighted warden of Faywood. Shame he had to fall, but at least that horrid blight is ceasing. I kept my distance from people back at my old home, though I do recall his name - Alder, it was.
				Dialogue12: I see you too have no use for neither fancy nor practical attire.
				Dialogue13: "I see you have decorated your hair with various flowers, to mimic or to mock me? That remains unclear. "
				Dialogue13ContCalm: Although, I do find it quite cute.
				Dialogue13ContShy: I'll take it as a compliment.
				Dialogue13ContJolly: It definitely suits you though!
				Dialogue13ContAggressive: Probably the latter.
				Dialogue13Cont: It suits you.
				DialogueDistrust: Leave. The fae's trust in you was an act of folly, the World deems you a danger.
				Dialogue14: Oh, how vulgar. You are able to see within the other realm and as such are bearing witness to my ethereal form. Or mayhaps you aren't submerged deep enough to see it in full? No matter.
				Dialogue15: You aren't blighted, are you? No, it is just a mask.
				Dialogue16: You better hope that wood you don is not from my home.
				Dialogue17: You don the wood of a living tree. If I find out you've taken it from my home, I won't be happy.
				Dialogue18: Better watch yourself.
				Dialogue19: Don't make yourself too comfy, I only trust you because of your fae's kind words about you.
				Dialogue20: The blossom you gave me is often gifted to others to bring good luck and the blessing of a long life. Being who I am - a forest nymph, as you'd call me - I can use these blossoms to grant me a greater soul and connection with the World; Epidotra, people call it.
				Dialogue21: Come to talk to me? I don't mind the company, as long as nature deems you well.
				Dialogue22: What do you want? I'd rather be left alone.
				Dialogue23: We nymphs are rather solitary beings, so consider the fact that I don't mind your presence a blessing.

				Chat1B: Fixing this crashed ship, and just reflecting on our fight. Honestly I'm just doing it because I got nothing else to do.
				Chat1C: The ship is fixed... I just can't be bothered to get up.
				Chat2: What's the matter, you never seen a spaceship before? Some android thought it'd be a good idea to 'borrow' it, and ended up yeeting it 20 feet under. Unfortunately I've ran out of Uranium, but I can't be bothered to find it right now.
				Chat2B: Yes. An android thought it'd be a good idea to 'borrow' it, and ended up yeeting it 20 feet under. The uranium you gave me should help.

				Chat4C: I wish I still was, mate. I can't eat or sleep in this robot body, but I still feel the pain of hunger and tiredness I can't satisfy. If it weren't for the AI I created for myself, I wouldn't be able to talk or move.
				Chat5: You saw my statue there? Yeah, I'm part of the Heroes. But it's pretty boring, I'm always assigned to kill the weaklings, like the Keeper.
				Chat5B: I did say I'm part of the Heroes, but I'm considering leaving. It's getting in the way of my... other projects.
				Chat5C: The members of the Heroes are all dingbats. The leader just travels around the world without aim, and I don't even know what the other 2 members are up to.
				Chat5D: There are 4 members of the Heroes. The first is that demigod doofus, honestly he's a chill guy, I just hate how much stronger he is compared to me. The 2nd member is some moron who's supposedly invincible, not once have I seen him get hurt. 3rd is... Well she's probably the most normal out of all of us, but I don't know what she's up to now.
				Chat5E: ... There's something strange about the Demigod's statue... It doesn't look like him. Did someone change it?

				Chat7B: The world is called Epidotra, it's where the Heroes are from.
				Chat7C: This tiny island appeared on this planet out of nowhere, I was going to check it out a year or so ago, but I remember seeing the demigod here so I didn't bother. The mainland has 6 continents, with Anglon, Ithon, Gathuram, Nirin, Erellon, and Thamor as the primary domains. There's another domain which is it's own island called Swaylan, but that's disconnected from the rest of the world.
				Chat8: The other world just suddenly appeared out of nowhere, I'm interested in it though. I've scanned the surface and it seems to be rather frozen, with so far no signs of human life. Reminds me of a planet I checked out while in space... In fact, reminds me of many planets.
				Chat8B: You see the planet on the right in that one hologram? That's what I've named Liden, a radioactive and desolate wasteland devoid of any life.
				Chat8C: I'll be leaving soon to check it out. Scans show barely any life, just a frozen radioactive wasteland.
				Chat9: Can you not read through my data logs please.
				Chat9B: I really just wrote those to keep my sanity. I don't want to tell you how boring travelling through space for a million years is.
				Chat9C: I wrote those every day I was in space, waiting for my world to be restored. Even though I'm back now, I don't feel satisfied.

				Talk: What would a meaningless protector offer in the ways of discussion..? Perhaps I may tell you about my past life... No, it's nothing but a blur now. Octavia resurrected me and kept my withering body moving for so long I have lost my old self. I'm barely an undead anymore, more so a spirit. But don't pity me, I enjoyed my time with her, it made me feel I had a purpose...
				Dialogue: Oh... I thank you for freeing my mistress from her sorrow. But now without her, what is my purpose. I do not yet feel fulfilled. If only I could have a token of her, an object of remembrance...
				SpiritTalk: You see, I was expecting to join my mistress in this realm, seeing as we were both freed of our sorrows. Contrariwise, I have no sight of her, none at all... I have looked and looked, but alas, I feel I am searching for a ghost - in the metaphorical and literal sense. If you know not of where she lies, I suppose I must continue my search. I must not let my vexation sway me, lest I turn vengeful.

				NoCruxDialogue: I'll need something to imbue, if you please.
				OfferCruxDialogue: I shall, if only you give unto my remains three flowers of the night. One for each of my band to fall to that vile demon.

				Dialogue2: Gorhal'on! Mur ye bagaiha ta? Mudarok abo.
				WhatDialogue: Hm? Ah, you must not know our language. Should've figured, this island has had nothing but Anglic speakers from what I've witnessed. You're lucky us spirits know all tongues, for we roam to hear and learn for eternity. What do you want?
				Chat1: Ta? I was once a resident of Gothrione - Gathuram's capital. I'm assuming you may know it better as the "Iron Realm"? I worked as an assassin there with a tight-knit group. We were some of the best; at least, that's what I told myself. In this realm of recollection I can only look back in light humour for how foolish my living-self was.
				Chat2: I would have it guessed you've been on this island and only this island, hm? Gathuram is one of the six primary domains of the mainland - possibly the largest, too. In terms of landmass, anyway. I've seldom been beyond the outer fields of Gothrione in my time of living, neither have I in my time of unliving, so I cannot speak to you of it in detail.
				Chat3: Gothione is the capital of the domain. It was quite the bustling city, however I cannot speak well of its ruler. Stubborn and snarky he was, in fact it was our mission to assassinate him. That was the last mission of our lives... As timing would have it, an invasion began on the day - it was horrific. In our last moments, we were gawking with heads bend up into the sky at a great demon terror.
				Chat4: Hm, a subject I have no desire to sink into. It's name I shall not utter, just know it was the vastest being of trepidation we had ever seen. It was the reason I never returned there as a spirit - I dreaded the sight of it or the aftermath of its destruction. Now let us speak of it no more.

				NoCruxDialogue: I'll need something to imbue first.
				OfferCruxDialogue: Gladly, however I request something in return. My remains lay empty-handed, if thou'st may offer upon them a weapon of my unit, then I shall be complacent. A lone corpse tells a bare tale.
				Dialogue: What manner of sorcery is this? And here I thought us immune to the physical world's presence...
				Chat1: Behold, for I am Kleo! Common Guard of Ricusa City! I'm sure if ye were a resident of Anglon you'd be jumping in shock to face such a legendary figure! Oh who am I kidding, my name barely made it past my own district. But no matter! I did my job well and that is all that matters!
				Chat2: By Grace! To think anyone who walks this earth be unaware of the greatest domain in Epidotra! The Hallowed Dominion is where I'm from, and Ricusa City is where I resided. 'Tis a peaceful and prosperous land, home to great cities and castles and all the protection thou canst get! Well, sort of.
				Chat3: Ah, Ricusa... It was such a grand capital - also one of the largest in the domain. Did you know it started as a humble village? Eventually the old capital was laid to ruin, and due to the village's steady growth it was promoted to the new capital. All seemed well for ages to come... That was until the demons came.
				Chat4: A great demon terror invaded the capital with his underlings, never before had I seen such power and brute strength come from a single creature. The walls were broken down and the two legendary brothers - Archon and Vargo - fought against them. They were great heroes, said they would trounce the demon forces back to Demonhollow. Yet for all their talk they were quickly killed by the leader with very little resistance, and so Ricusa City fell to the scourge. Like much else before it.

				NoRealmCruxDialogue: Get a little more into the Spirit Realm, and I will give it to you.
				CruxDialogue: A fine flower. It'll do. Take it, take the spirit of a goliath. It will serve you well, as it had to I.
				NoCruxDialogue: I'll need something to imbue first.
				OfferCruxDialogue: You'll be lucky. I do not give to Anglonic fol'hakks freely. Assuming you are from that haughty place? It matters not, if you offer a blessing to me, I shall do the same to you. I request an enchanted flower to grow atop my grave - a blue one, preferably. Find one that looks pretty.
				Dialogue: Tokk'gralvr! Dorvr'kok ok kolbv? Ah, groa'g Anglic fofolg. It's always Anglic speakers, never any of my own... Whatever. I don't know how you took me back to my place of defeat, do you want something from me?
				Chat1: Sent me back to look upon my remains and now you ask for a friendly chat. Gralvr! What a strange thing. Speaking to spirits has become a bore, so I might as well. I come from the Kul'don rainforests in what most call Thamor. We lived as a commune of druids, far from others. To us, the world was a small thing, we kept to ourselves and never stepped foot beyond our territory.
				Chat2: It is what the other spirits I've met call the region I lived in. During my time of being alive, I had never thought of what the world was like beyond the rainforests, as we had never travelled beyond them. To us, the rainforests were our entire world, at least until we were forced out.
				Chat3: A reasonable question. Of course, the portals here lead to Anglon and Gathuram, none are even close to Thamor, let alone the wilds of Kul'don. We were driven out by force, a posse of Anglonic soldiers came by in search of our goliaths - ones we had tamed and have been a part of our commune for generations. We retaliated of course, and drove them out. A short-lived victory, for they reappeared with their leader. They not only captured our goliaths, but us as well. To Anglon we were sent, and it is there I had escaped.

			SpiritGathicMan: {
				NoRealmCruxDialogue: Get in tha Spirit Realm, garbar! Can't do anythin' otherwise!
				CruxDialogue: Weapon's a bit dusty but it'll do nicely. You wanted ma crux? Sure thing, lad! Have the spirits of my people, and may they stab ya foes hard!
				NoCruxDialogue: Gimme somethin' to imbue first!
				OfferCruxDialogue: Of course! But first, I'd like ya to give ma corpse a weapon. Let the bone-heads and tomb raiders know I died fightin'! A big ol' battleaxe will do.
				Dialogue: RAAAARRGGGHH! Haha! I saw ya comin' with ya fancy artifact, knew ya might call me with it, so I was ready to give ya a jump! No reaction? Come on, I yelled pretty loud. Not even a slight shiver in ya boots? Whatever, what is it?
				Chat1: They called me the "Brain Cleaver" back in ma prime, for reasons I'm sure ya can figure out. My real name was somethin' less intense - Bromal. I was a warrior of Iful's Capital in the ol' kingdom of Kol Duluramodul before the undead took over. Now it's known as the Olden Ruins.
				Chat2: A rotting mass of land east of Gathuram, a domain. During ma time there were no such things as "domains", the kingdom was just about all I knew. The folk of it ere the fall came from up north-east, migrating from the sinking Eranmount. They named their new land Odulmount - meaning Great Swamp in your tongue - but after lifetimes of glory, it was renamed to Kol Duluramodul - meaning Immovable Swamp Kingdom. It was indeed an impenetrable land, until the God of Decay appeared.
				Chat3: A disease swept through Kol Duluramodul like an air-borne tsunami. The cause was the False God of Decay who roamed Tethuram - Gathuram's name in ancient times. It rotted and corroded flesh and turned humans into undead. The swamps, we discovered, were where the infection thrived most, so the folk who yet lived abandoned the kingdom and travelled further west. Such hard times they were, I only look back in anguish for my people.
				Chat4: Be thankful for the present ya live in now. The Ancient World was an unforgiving age, made worse by the False Gods. We only knew of one at the time - after becoming a spirit I learnt a lot more about them from others of the realm. Apparently there was also one in Anglon, Blight I believe. For all the knowledge a thousand spirits can give, not one knows of the False Gods' origins. They're all dead though, the last of 'em was felled by ye olde Light. And I'm not talking about the Light you may know.
				Chat5: Aye, I know of the artifact you carry, in fact it was created in Iful's Capital! 'Tis designed to call upon the spirits of corpses. Originally, the purpose was for gainin' knowledge of the past, but overtime we used it for more personal reasons - such as lettin' the dead talk to their family an' friends. I am unsure why it was found beneath this island though.

				Dialogue: Oooh...
				Chat1: Me? Unsure. I was from a place. My recollection fails me... It was cold, too cold for my liking. I split myself, and dug. Dug for our new kingdom.
				Chat2: A new kingdom in snowy mountains, the old perished. We left, found ourselves here. The natives called it Nirin. They helped us, we helped them. Together we recreated our technology, we taught them our wisdom. All was well.
				Chat3: Mine? Yes, and no. I am part of a piece, infused within the inanimate to become animate. Automatons we are. Powered by the permanent soul. My true spirit lies elsewhere, I alone am too frail. I wish to become whole again.

			SpiritWalkerMan: {
				NoRealmCruxDialogue: Sorry! Can't give ya anything while you're completely in the physical realm. Peak in and I'll give it to ya!
				CruxAsherDialogue: I see, I see. Within this tophat lies an odd spirit. I don't believe I've ever met it before, but they appear ta be quite powerful.
				CruxDialogue: Bravo! I 'ave infused ya card with the spirits of two skeletons, use some souls to summon 'em! They'll assist ya in battle, or make nice company if ya feelin' lonely. They do 'ave a mind of their own, so if they scurry off somewhere, use the card to tug their souls back! Keep in mind, other spirits may wish for somethin' in return for these.
				NoCruxDialogue: Ya don't have anythin' I can imbue. If you want help findin' somethin', I'll say to look for those gathic tombs scattered aroun' the caverns. Ya might find somethin' in there.
				NoCruxAsherDialogue: There's somethin' in that hat I can use to imbue into something, however, ya don't have anythin' for me to imbue.
				OfferCruxDialogue: Only if you may, bring me six gemstones of the purest shine, and lay them around my remains. Six are the hands of an angel. Their arms hold us so...
				Dialogue1: Great! You figured out how ta' call me! I hope ya take fancy to ma' gift. I'm err, let's just say a spiritual enthusiast. Ask me anythin'!
				Dialogue2: "Ey, that old tophat ya got has something spiritual 'bout it, "
				Dialogue2Cont: peak into the Spirit Realm for a bit so I can get a closer look.
				Dialogue2Mid: "Take it off an' "
				Chat1: The ability given to ya gives you a peak into the Spirit Realm - A realm parallel to our own. Normally, neither realm can see nor interact with each other. You'll be able to hurt spirits with any method or find corpses to use that bell thing-a-ma-jig on while peakin'. Such as mine! Another thing, we spirits can gift to you our "crux" if ya have somethin' to imbue it in - just request it while spirit walkin'.
				Chat2: A nifty artifact of Gathuram, that is. Usin' it on corpses will force their spirit back to their location while tuggin' them outta the Spirit Realm a tad, which is why you can see me now even if you stopped spirit walkin' despite me being a full-fledged spirit - not one of those Vagrants or Lost Souls.
				Chat3: When folk die, their soul leaves their body to find anotha'. During this pilgrimage, they're still connected to the physical world, meanin' some with the arcane eye may see 'em. If a lost soul wanders too long, they can seep outta the spirit realm and become Vagrant Spirits - poor things forever lost.
				Chat4: I couldn't tell ya where to find corpses to use it on, but I can recommend findin' spirit currents. They're only visible in my realm, and can take ya closer to a soulful corpse if ya travel through one. You'll only find 'em in caverns, as that'll be where our energy is most contained. If ya do find what you're lookin' for, be wary. Tombs of the mighty are seldom left unguarded.
				Chat4B: I once met anotha' spirit in a mind-bogglin' location! It felt outta this world. The walls were white, pipes with green fluids hung from ceilings, strange blue lights emitted from metal boxes an' tubes... And the spirit I saw was most intriguing! He just kept repeatin' about alarms, and wore a strange white an' blue suit. Very odd.
				Chat5: Like I said, I've been a spirit so long that I forgot my own name, yet I still remember most other things 'bout me. Strange that. I'm from Gathuram, the portal behind me leads to the Catacombs of Gathuram, and is how the undead and skeleton folk came here. Doesn't seem like you can enter it though.
				CalaviaDialogue1: "'Ey, ya see that lass over yonder? There be somethin' soulful she carries, I can sense it. Would you, out of the goodness of yer heart, confront her about it for me? Don't want to assume nothin', but she might be keepin' a spirit captive."
				CalaviaDialogue2: I can sense gratitude within Kyretha's spirit for confrontin' the lass and ultimately leading 'er to a path of freedom. I have a feelin' she'd be willin' to offer you something in return?
			}

			Calavia: {
				Chat1: Again I must apologise for attacking ye, I asked for your purpose but clearly ye aren't Gathic. I should introduce myself, I am Calavia, a Chief-Warrior of the Iron Realm. It is such a pleasure to meet a khen here, I've seen naught but rotting khru ever since I got here.
				Chat2: You are the first khen I've met here - there's been floods of krhu around, so I prefer the change.
				Chat3: That corpse by the portal is oddly soulful, I hope it doesn't come alive.
				Chat4: You got a strange ability from that soulful corpse by the portal? My worries of it becoming a danger must've been unfounded, though I yet sense a will therein.
				Chat5: Are you perhaps another warrior of the Iron Realm to stumble upon this place? Or did you rob that armour you wear?
				Chat6: I am to assume you're an Anglic knight, based on your attire. Should've figured you wouldn't understand Gathic... Oh well.
				Chat7: That armour you don is rather threatening. Where did it come from? Reminds me of the Thamor'in dragons that occassionally hinder the western countries.
				IntroLine1: Yeah I came from the portal, 'twas atop a snowy precipice. When I tried going back through however, it took me into what I can only assume to be Gathuram's catacombs. Back and forth I went, yet it was always the same. Here, catacombs, here, catacombs... It is infuriating! How these portals work!?
				IntroLine2: Precisely! I have a family anticipating my return, yet I see no way back to where I came from. Do ye know anything at all about portals?
				IntroLine3: Our squadron climbed up a mountain to retrieve the body of a famous warrior, and came upon the portal. We should've reported it to the Riftwatch and carried on our business, but my witless curiousity said otherwise and chose to take a looksie. "In and out, nice and quick" I thought. Needless to say, ye can see how smart that idea was.
				IntroLine4: How helpful. Not like I can blame ye, they're magic of a bygone age. Only the Riftwatch have knowledge of 'em. Speaking of which, they must've been here before. Portals don't just appear with a stone ring and foundation pre-'rected - 'tis the Riftwatch's job to build those. To stabilize 'em, or so I've heard.
				IntroLine5: Well I can't just mope around forever, the only way forward is scramming through the catacombs and praying to Sariel I find a way to the surface. It'll be a massive gamble tho', the catacombs are like a subterranean domain in their own right!
				IntroLine5B: " I'll stick around for now, maybe if ye give me a [i:Redemption/GathicCryoFurnace]furnace I could offer ye some smithing."
				IntroLine6: How polite of ye to ask. After our little squabble my helm and shield are quite... thrashed. I have nobody to blame but myself, but anyway, if ye could give me some replacements and supplies to aid me, I will be most grateful.
				IntroLine7: I'll need it... Actually, would ye be a dear and get me some equipment to aid me? My shield and helm took quite a blow. Not like I can blame ye, I did initiate the clash.
				IntroLine8: A new [i:Redemption/PureIronHelmet]Pure-Iron Helmet, and some [i/s6:Redemption/PureIronAlloy]Pure-Iron Alloy for remaking my shield. That is all I ask of ye. If ye give me a [i:Redemption/GathicCryoFurnace]furnace I can offer some help back. I work as a blacksmith on the side.
				IntroLine9: ... So ye think I can survive the catacombs as I stand? If ye won't assist me, I suppose I got no choice but to give it a shot. I still have some of this place's potions left over, they've come in real handy. Guess I'll stick around in case ye change your mind.
				IntroLine10: Thank ye, stranger. I'll need a new [i:Redemption/PureIronHelmet]Pure-Iron Helmet, and some [i/s6:Redemption/PureIronAlloy]Pure-Iron Alloy for remaking my shield. That is all I ask of ye. If ye give me a [i:Redemption/GathicCryoFurnace]furnace I can offer some help back. I work as a blacksmith on the side.
				IntroLine11: ... If ye insist. *sigh* This'll be a challenge, but I'll trust your judgement. I'll make it through to reunite with my squadron and finally return to my family, there is no better motivation than that. Farewell, stranger.
				IntroLine12: Still something you need? Or do you not feel I'm ready?
				ReadyLine: As ready as I can be. I still have a few potions from this place, I've never seen such concoctions before... They must've been created by a master alchemist.
				HelmetLine: Umgor'ye. The khru are ruthless creatures, a helmet to protect my neck an' head is much appreciated.
				HelmetLineB: " Oh, and it is an antique design too? The fur is a nice privilege."
				ShieldLine: Umgor'ye. I feel much safer with a shield.
				RequirementsLine: A new [i:Redemption/PureIronHelmet]Pure-Iron Helmet, and some [i/s6:Redemption/PureIronAlloy]Pure-Iron Alloy for remaking my shield. That is all I ask of ye.

					Ye have given me the helmet so far. I don't doubt it'll be enough, yet I'd feel much safer with a shield too.

				MistfallLine: That spell tome ye hold is quite weak, would ye like it to become similar to my own?
				ZweihanderLine: Ye carry a Zweihander? That is a famous blade of the Iron Realm, and so too was it the original form of the Blade of the Mountain - a sword of a mighty warrior who unfortunately fell to a great beast, I am its new holder. Would ye like me to make a replica of it?
				FurnaceLine: Yes, place down a [i:Redemption/GathicCryoFurnace]Gathic Cryo-Furnace near me and I will offer to forge some equipment for ye.
				AboutMeLine: Ta? I am a chief-warrior and blacksmith of the Iron Realm. Back in Khen Boldur I have a husband and two kids. I seldom have the time to see 'em, but staying far apart only makes the moments we're together all-the-more special, or am I just bein' too optimistic? It's regrettable, but my job leaves no room for indulgences. I lead a squadron of Arum that primarily scouts out unmarked lands. My men have probably given up on me by now. Typical.
				CruxDialogue: Kyretha's spirit feels lighter - less shrouded in negative emotion. Alas, that means what the spirit spoke of is true, the barons hide a darkness I have turned a blind eye to. Ya know what? If I ever get back to Arum, I'll look into it, all stealth-like. But anywho, I do believe she'll be willing to give ye her crux, she offers it freely.
				NoCruxDialogue: Kyretha's spirit feels different now. I never realised the aura I felt was not of her power but of a strong negative emotion, it was foolish to assume the feeling was the norm for spirits of her splendour. I can comphrehend her emotions more clearer, and I do believe she's willing to give ye her crux, if ye have something to imbue.
				ConfrontLine1: Hm? Oh, so ye noticed. Yeah, I carry a bauble containing a spirit. I didn't elaborate on my job because it's none of ya business. Alas, clarification is in order so ye don't get any wrong ideas.
				ConfrontLine2: The spirit I carry is of the original wielder of the Blade of the Mountain, Kyretha, who was slain in an isolated range. She was part of a "unique" group who's souls were bound to another, and due to this I was tasked with retrieving her body and soul to send back to the Bastion of Arum - The barons deemed this of utmost priority. I recognise the taboo nature of ensnaring a spirit in glass, but I hope ye understand now.
				LeaveLine: Thank you for the help, and sorry for the trouble. What lies ahead makes me uneasy, but I'll make it through to reunite with my squadron and finally return to my family, there is no better motivation than that. Farewell, stranger.

Dangers have come and gone, but none have ever sought to demolish this shrine. To Fairwood I return - I have missed its lush forests and bark'en friends. Mayhaps you be this shrine's new protector..? If it needs one, anyway.
				ShrineDialogue2: What's that shrine behind me..? It was built by a group of humans, long dead by now, as a place of worship to some sort of figure... I don't recall their name, but I know they were a good friend of nature. Some may consider her the Mother of Nature..? Hmmm... My memory grows distant in my old age.

Maybe I was unwise, but I have seen more of us coming from our lands in recent times, so perhaps the others grew adventurous too.

				Dialogue3: You wouldn't happen to see a brambly young man..? Poor thing was gulped up by the cursed forest we once lived in. I toil with no humans, but I do wonder if he's alright...
				Dialogue4: You remind me of that young warden, did the forest's curse get you too..?
				Dialogue5: Are you friend, or foe? As long as you don't use your axe on me, I don't care...

				CycleDialogue1: Girus is after a certain bot, Adam was his name. He is the leader of a rebellion alongside 4 others, some of the most fierce bots I have seen. However, one was a human, they haven't been seen much - presumed dead by most. Other than them there are a few independent bots, but there isn't much to say about them.
				CycleDialogue2: The leader of the insurgents - or the Alpha as they call themselves - is Adam. He isn't the strongest, but he isn't to be underestimated. He matches Girus in intelligence, yet opposes her, hindering her whenever he can. This makes me question why she hasn't permitted his death yet, we've lost too many troops trying to capture him alive.
				CycleDialogue3: Insurgents aren't the easiest to deal with, two of them especially have given the most casualties. One is a sniper, Shiro was her name, wielding one of the most powerful rifles the humans have ever made, powered by Charged Xenomite. I haven't heard much of her recently. The other is an enigma, I believe he's called Talos, he wields a hammer. Both he and his weapon are powered by yellow Xenomite, a variant I've never seen before; appears to be the most potent, yet I don't know where it came from, logs do not track the humans creating it. [i:Redemption/NextPageArrow]
				CycleDialogue4: Ah yes the fourth insurgent, Zeroth was his name. He wielded bladed gloves powered by blue Xenomite. They could send a 2-and-a-half meter tall bot through a solid wall. I'd know, that was me. What happened to him however is beyond me. He is the only insurgent to have died. By who, however, I don't know. One day he just disappeared, much like the other two, but after a while, we found what was left of him - what we can assume to be him. We only identified it was Zeroth via his weapon at the scene.
				CycleDialogue5: Not everyone who doesn't follow Girus wants to oppose her. There's a band of bots all throughout this region, we call them Scavengers. They don't work for us or the insurgents, rather they do not interfere with either of us. I've heard some cases of insurgents attacking them, which makes me question why they act morally superior.
				CycleDialogue6: Ah yes that unfinished weapon downstairs, don't know much about it as its mainly the Crane Operator's job to control it. Apparently it was being made by the humans to defeat their enemies. Seems rather silly really, wouldn't the enemies just respond with their own version? I am to assume that was the thought process of the humans, I saw it on TV. Yes we had one some time back. It broke...
				CycleDialogue7: One of the few staff we have down here, she mainly handles the machinery, thus the name. I doubt most of us could tell you much about her, she keeps to herself mostly, not very social. She is still a valuable member of the team here however, one of two of us to know how to operate complex machinery.
				CycleDialogue8: Sector Zero yes? If I am correct, it was the infirmary when the humans had control. I cannot tell you much else, we are forbidden from going there by Girus and the Janitor. The Janitor doesn't want to clean up all the gunk, and most of us don't want to anger him. I am unsure why Girus forbids us however.
				CycleDialogue9: Our leader. She freed us from the humans who were going to use us as weapons, she is very strict with us but it mostly keeps the peace, save for the infected or the insurgents. I'd recommend not angering her, the best thing that comes out of that is a quick and painless death. If you are like us, you are likely to get assimilated, Girus never seems to kill her own kind.
				CycleDialogue10: Assimilated troops are a variation of your average T-Bot, powered by Girus' own Corrupted Xenomite instead of regular green. They are mostly misbehaving soldiers who had their personality wiped. They are mindless but pack a punch.
				CycleDialogue11: Girus has told us we were going to be used as weapons of war by our previous owners, a weapon company named Teo-Chrome. She put a stop to that. To most bots, that makes her worthy of being our leader, however some disagree.
				CycleDialogue12: I wonder if the insurgents have someone constructing their own variant of xenomite. Thankfully for us, Talos hasn't been seen for some time now.
				Bot1: Promoted to a soldier? Welcome. I'm your commander. At ease.
				Bot2: Regular check-ups on your non-lethal tesla weapons are advised. You do not want to overload an insurgent in front of Girus. Obedient mindless slave are better than scrap metal, she says.
				Bot3: See an insurgent while patrolling? Do not engage alone. They have lethal weaponry. We don't. Get backup.
				Normal1: You wish to talk? I accept your request.
				Normal2: What is it you need?
				Volt1: Had your eye augmented? Very useful. You've also lost your jaw, like me. Hopefully not as dramatically as I. Torn off by the leader of Alpha.
				Volt2: Your jaw... It's gone. Hopefully not torn off violently. Really hope I don't face HIM again without a squad... *Shudders*
				Adam1: *Visibly shaken* O-oh it's just you. Y-you startled me r-really bad...
				Adam2: *He looks really anxious*
				Adam3: *He looks very uncomfortable*

				Dialogue5: Fighting evil or helping those in need sets you along a righteous path with unique items and quests.

			Janitor: {
				ChatJanitor1: So you've been assigned to janitor duty, eh? Here's a task, go to the reactors and remove that dense lava stuff from under the reactor. My Nano-chisel won't even leave a mark on it!
				ChatJanitor2: About time she got me an assistant to help clean this mess of a place. Remember to check under the tables for dust.
				Chat1: Bugger off, you're bringing a whole bunch of dust in here!
				Chat2: Oh it's you again. You better not interrupt my cleaning.
				Chat3: Make it quick, I've got to resume mopping the floor.
				ChatClean: Without grime what is my purpose? Doesn't matter, I'll continue mopping until all particles of dust are wiped from this place. It's my job after all.
				CycleDialogue1: You've probably seen the personnel who are basically walking corpses, ye? Our security usually deals with them, but it's not enough. They crawl out of overrun rooms like goddamn cockroaches! And I am the one who has to clean all the mess left by them and security.
				CycleDialogue1Clean: The ceiling. Now leave me to my mopping! No floor is truly freed of muck.
				CycleDialogue2: The other bots have learned to fear me. Good for me, I can actually focus on my job. Except now there is a certain someone bugging me. Hmm, I wonder who it could be... Now bugger off!
				CycleDialogue3: The big bot at Sector Omicron is a cool guy, if you ask me. Probably the only bot I don't feel annoyed by. Now if you excuse me, you brought in some of that slime with ya and I have to clean that up!
				CycleDialogue4: There's this one copper-haired bot that I can recall, who works as the crane operator in the Mech Storage room. I don't know that much about her, but her design is a little peculiar. Not that she's more feminine, but the hair... Why tho'?
				CycleDialogue5: Don't you dare go into Sector Zero, that place is absolutely filled with the impossible-to-remove black slime! And I don't want ye to bring that stuff here for me to try to pry off the steel plating of the lab! Takes ages.
				CycleDialogue5Clean: I dunna. Girus forbids it, and I wouldn't wanna cross her.
				CycleDialogue6: Respect Girus and she will learn to respect you. Quite sure I'll get a change of a job after half a century of cleaning the lab after the... incident. Don't ask me 'bout it, I was activated AFTER it happened.
