# RedemptionAlpha

TODO
- Change colour npcs get from infested debuff to a more subtle green-yellow
- Aggressive Flies (Would be a new variable in normal fly code i guess, maybe uses npc.ai[3])
- Sandskin Spider (Burrows into sand if on sand tile and player or enemy is near, can resurface when clear)
- Devil's Tongue
- Living Bloom
- Change projectile source of the trees to tile breaking when its added
- Add buzzing sound to flies when custom sounds work
