TODO

- Gigapora Shader (i believe in you snowy :sadcat:)
- Midnight weapon code + apply the shader to the flames
- Give Gigapora Cores attacks
- Code Divinity, a spell tome that flashes bright lights at the enemy, doing holy and fire damage. (it would look like a mini version of Seth's heat snaps from Split mod probably)
- Code Rockslide, a spell tome that uses a mix of Earth and Psychic magic. Earth magic will create a large amount of rocks, being lifted by psychic magic, cap of 10 rocks. Release to throw the rocks at the target, which will explode into further damaging rubble. 
- Code Steampunk Minigun, just a minigun that replaces normal bullets with high velocity ones
- Code Hyper-Tech Revolver, twin revolvers, player can throw one in the air with right-click and catching it will increase shot speed or something
- Reduced player knockback effect from the Egg Shelld accessory (player knockback changing is wack)
- Rework Erhan's expert mode changes, which will involve him reading from the Holy Bible now, and improving his empowered attacks
