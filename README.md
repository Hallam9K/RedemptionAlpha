# RedemptionAlpha

To build the mod yourself, download and unzip in your \Terraria\tModLoader\ModSources folder, and rename "RedemptionAlpha" to "Redemption"
Make sure the path is ModSources/Redemption/.. and NOT ModSources/Redemption/Redemption/..

Borrowing any code that isn't said to be from another mod is fine as long as you ask first.
You do not have permission to take or modify any assets such as music or sprites for your own mod.
