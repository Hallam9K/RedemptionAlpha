MULTIPLAYER DOESN'T WORK

Discord:

This mod requires IQ above room temperature, if you want a mod you can mindlessly go through without much thought this isn't for you.

THIS IS A BETA, THE FOLLOWING CONTENT IS **NOT** IN THIS VERSION, BUT IS PLANNED FOR FULL 0.8:
- Multiplayer Compatibility (Multiplayer is broken)
- Ritualist Class
- Soulless Caverns along with it's boss
- Deep Space
- 4th Omega Prototype
- Ruined Kingdom
- Post-ML Biome Expansions

This beta does however have:
- Erhan, a new pre-hardmode boss
- Reworking of basically every weapon
- Overhaul to the Abandoned Lab
- Many boss reworks or tweaks
- Alignment, a semi-work-in-progress mechanic where actions can alter alignment, so far it only changes if Dragon-Lead or Gathic Cryo-Crystals will gen and if Nebuleus will let you fight a new phase, but more will be planned.
- Removal of druid class, as the quality no longer matches the rest of the mod, however be patient for the upcoming Ritualist Class!
- Elemental system where weapons and projectiles can have elements set to them that certain enemies can be resistant or weak to
- Guard Points, a new value that blocks damage for a certain amount of hits until its broken, enemies with guard points wont take knockback. Hammers and explosives deal triple damage to guard points and Psychic elemental weapons will ignore guard points completely.
- Removal of bloat content
- Reworks of various enemy AIs
- Fowl Morning Event (Chicken Invasion Rework)

Mod of Redemption is a lore-based mod (very scary) that adds a wide range of content.
Currently, there are:
- 1002 Items
- 198 NPCs/Enemies
- 11 Bosses
- 11 Minibosses
- 439 Tiles
