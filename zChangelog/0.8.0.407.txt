- Improved visuals of Iron Realm Sword
- 'elementalMultiplier' Mod Call now sets the multipliers
- Projectiles with inherited elements will give those elements to other projectiles spawned by them, including ones inherited from items

1682. Forest Nymph's Sickle can now have the common prefixes, and buffed damage of magic's ability from 30% -> 15% less base damage
1862. Added Spear Bonus that pierces through Guard Points
2082. Changed Xeno Xyston spin sprite to look less sussy and changed knockback formula
2089. Cleaned elements in tooltips, now a row of the icons
2090. Added Arcane element to more of the mod's projectiles, only Arcane element can hit spirit realm enemies now (Holy, Celestial, and Psychic also used to) Arcane acts more like a bonus now for anything magical (not limited to magic class)
2091. Added Elemental Stats UI to view all your elemental resistance and damage percentages
2092. Some Elemental damage effects affect players now too (Taking extra Thunder damage when wet, extra Earth damage while grounded, more knockback while airborne from Wind damage etc.)
2093. Elemental damage increases/decreases are shown in a weapon's damage tooltip, can choose from 2 styles or disable it in config
2094. Split config options into "Personal Config" and "Global Config" for clientside and serverside changes
2095. Evil Jelly also grants 8% increased Shadow elemental damage
2096. Holoshield grants 10% extra damage reduction against non-elemental damage
2097. Living Wood set bonus also grants 15% increased Nature elemental damage and resistance
2099. Changed text colours of elements
2100. Added Book of Bonuses, given by Wayfarer when looking at the advice on Elemental Basics, has a list of all 19* elemental and bonus effects, triggering a bonus' effect will reveal it in the book. This will be how to learn what bonuses do now (*Clash Bonus isn't included yet)
2101. Moved Crystallized Knowledge to pre-hm, rewarded by the Wayfarer after filling out the Book of Bonuses. Increased its cost from 3 gold to sell -> 6 gold to buy
2102. Added a new effect for Blood Bonus: Blood Loss accumulates on continuous hits, causing a burst of percentage damage (100 flat + 15% max health on normal enemies, 100 flat + 5% on bosses), Blood Loss is harder to cause the more times its applied to a single enemy, crits double the amount of build-up, build-up is based on damage and max fill is based on the enemy's max health, Elemental Resistance or Weakness to Blood will affect the build-up and total flat damage
2103. Added Mod Calls for calling Decapitation and setting Slash, Axe, Hammer and Spear bonus to items and projectiles (none for Spear on items since there's already the vanilla ID.Sets for spears)
2106. Decreased chance of Keeper naturally spawning from 1/3 -> 1/4
2107. Eaglecrest Golem can take knockback, but has Guard Points while rolled into boulder, breaking the guard points halves his defense for the rest of the fight and deals 500 damage
2108. Eaglecrest Rockpiles take more knockback and pickaxes deal extra damage
2111. Most of the mod's music volume is louder, as it was in 1.3
